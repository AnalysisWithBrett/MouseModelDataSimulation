## Project Overview

Welcome to the readme file for my dissertation proposal project! This project marks a significant milestone in my academic journey as it serves as a precursor to my main university research project. Here, I will outline the key details and processes involved in this endeavor.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to investigate the potential effects of antibiotics within the gut microbiota of three distinct mouse groups. By delving into this topic, I aimed to lay the groundwork for my main university research project while honing my skills in data analysis and visualization. 

## Project Phases

### Preparation

The project kicked off with meticulous preparation. I initiated by organizing crucial information in an Excel sheet, which included details about mouse ID and their corresponding cohorts. This step was pivotal in structuring the data for subsequent analysis.

### Data Generation with R

Utilizing the power of R programming, I proceeded to generate simulated data values for each mouse. Drawing insights from existing scientific studies, I ensured the authenticity and relevance of the simulated data, setting a strong foundation for my subsequent analyses.

### Visualization and Statistical Analysis

With the simulated data at hand, I embarked on a comprehensive journey of data exploration and analysis. Leveraging R's robust capabilities, I crafted a diverse array of visualizations to represent my predictions effectively. Moreover, I delved into intricate statistical analyses, encompassing techniques such as linear modeling, transformations (including log and Box-Cox), quadratic models, interactions, and random effects. These analyses were instrumental in delineating the most suitable visualizations and statistical approaches for the impending main university research project.

## Project Impact

This project stands as a pivotal milestone in my academic trajectory. It has equipped me with indispensable skills, knowledge, and hands-on experience essential for navigating the complexities of research endeavors. By immersing myself in data analysis and visualization, I have fortified my capabilities to tackle intricate research questions and extract meaningful insights from data.

## Conclusion

In essence, this dissertation proposal project encapsulates the essence of academic exploration and inquiry. It underscores the significance of meticulous preparation, robust data analysis, and insightful visualization in unraveling the mysteries of scientific inquiry. As I transition towards my main university research project, I carry forward the invaluable lessons and experiences gleaned from this endeavor, poised to embark on new frontiers of discovery and innovation.

Thank you for exploring this readme file, and I look forward to sharing further developments in my academic journey.
